# Spam Classifier

In this code, you will find the training/testing process of Spam Classifier using Naive Bayes. 

As the dataset was imbalance, I had use over sampling SMOTE, which boosted the accuracy of the model.

Also to utilize the trained model, I developed a web app using Flask, where you can enter and verify whether the mail is SPAM OR NOT!
